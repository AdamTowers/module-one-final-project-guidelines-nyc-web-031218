# Myxology

Congratulations, you're are one of the first users to experience what will soon be the next big thing to disrupt Silicon Valley.

We over at the <i>Myxology</i> offices truly believe that we are making the world a better place, through comprehensive search oriented CLI programming.

## Overview

Ok, all jokes aside, <i>Myxology</i> is a CLI application created by two students at the Flatiron School in New York, NY. It helps you look up cocktail recipes and see relevant results based off of what ingredients you have available to you.

### Logging In

1. If you haven't already, create a login by entering in `create account`.
2. The program will then prompt you to create a username.
3. If you already have a username, first enter `login` then type in your username.

### Main Menu

1. Once you're logged in, you will see a menu of options. All of these options can be entered in at this level.
2. `Inventory` will show you all items in your inventory. To add items to your inventory, enter `add ingredient`. To remove items from your inventory, enter `remove ingredient` and then enter in the name of the ingredient you'd like to remove.
3. `Favorites` will show you all the cocktails you have saved in your inventory. To add a cocktail to your favorites, type in `add cocktail` which will ask you to input the cocktail you'd like to add. You can also enter `remove cocktail` which will function the same way, asking you which cocktail you'd like to remove.
4. If you aren't sure which cocktail you'd like to add, you can search for a specific cocktail by entering `search cocktail`, or you can enter `options` to see a list of all cocktails that you have ingredients for.
5. You are also able to create your own recipe by entering `create cocktail`. When you're done, it will be added to our database for other users to interact with. Should you want to make changes to the cocktail you've created, enter `update cocktail` which will ask you which part of the cocktail recipe you'd like to update.
6. Should you want to review a cocktail, you can enter `review cocktail` which you can rate on a scale of 1-10. Don't enter something other than one of those whole numbers, otherwise it will throw you an error!
7. OMG we also have `cocktail roulette`, which will give you a random cocktail from our database.

### And that's it!
We really enjoyed working on this project and may very well revisit it again in the future to further improve and expand on.

### Special thanks
We'd like to thank the creators of TheCocktailDB, over at [thecocktaildb.com](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/), for making the massive database of drinks available for to students, like us.
